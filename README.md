## || What Do? ||

- Run speed when in combat is no longer reduced.
- Walk and run speeds both in and out of combat can be tuned at the top of the script if you would like to tune it to your taste.
- Install using [Fluffy Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/14).

## || IMPORTANT NOTES ||

- In some sections, the objective walk and run speeds are altered by the game. Testers report Leon feels a bit faster in the early areas of Chapter 1, but then it normalizes afterward.
- If speeds remain undesirable after Chapter 1, you can tune them at the top of the script. The comments near each speed parameter show the default values as a reference.

## || Troubleshooting ||

If speeds suddenly seem **weird**:

1. Press **Insert** to open the [REFramework](https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/12) menu.
2. Open **Script Runner**.
3. Press **Reset Scripts** at the top center of **Script Runner**.
4. **Profit**.
5. If no Profit, [Modding Haven](https://discord.gg/modding-haven-718224210270617702) is the fastest place to reach me.
